## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* **ESP-EYE 32 Module:** Ensure you have the Espressif ESP-EYE 32.
* **ESP-IDF or Arduino IDE with ESP32 Support:** Set up the development environment.
* **Edge Impulse Account:** Create a free account on [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/).
* **Python 3.x or Node.js:** For data preprocessing and utility scripts.
* **ESP Tool:** For flashing and debugging.

### 2. Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DeepVisionEdge.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DeepVisionEdge.git)
    cd DeepVisionEdge
    ```

2.  **Prepare Your Dataset:**
    * Capture 300 images (100 each) of keys, mobile phones, and bottles from various angles.
    * Organize these images into the `dataset/key`, `dataset/mobile_phone`, and `dataset/bottle` subdirectories.

3.  **Edge Impulse Setup:**
    * Log in to your Edge Impulse account.
    * Create a new project.
    * Upload the images from the `dataset` folder.
    * Label the images appropriately.
    * Create an impulse (processing block + learning block).
    * Train your model using transfer learning (e.g., MobileNetV2).
    * Test the model's performance in the "Live classification" tab.
    * Go to "Deployment" and select "ESP32."
    * Build and download the `.zip` file containing the ESP32 model.
    * Extract the `.zip` file and place the `esp32_model.tflite` file into the `models` folder.

4.  **ESP-EYE 32 Deployment:**
    * Install ESP-IDF or configure Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support.
    * Copy the relevant code from `scripts/esp32_inference.c` or adjust the Arduino example from your edge impulse download.
    * Place the code into your ESP32 project.
    * Configure the project to include the tflite model.
    * Compile and flash the code onto your ESP-EYE 32 using the ESP Tool or IDE.
    * Connect to the serial monitor to view the inference results.

### 3. Running and Testing

* Power up your ESP-EYE 32 module.
* Present the objects (key, mobile phone, bottle) in front of the camera.
* Observe the real-time object recognition results on the serial monitor.

## 📈 Results

* Achieved an accuracy of approximately 89% in object recognition.
* Real-time inference with minimal latency.
* Detailed results and performance metrics are available in `documentation/results.md`.
